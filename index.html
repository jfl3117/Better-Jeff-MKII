                <p>Zachary Horton is a media, literary, and environmental scholar, as well as a filmmaker, photographer, and camera designer.  He is an Assistant Professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
                <p>Zach received his PhD from UC Santa Barbara in September 2015. His academic research primarily focuses on the relationship between scale, ecology, and technological mediation.  He worked for five years as a Fellow and researcher at the national Center For Nanotechnology in Society, where he focused on innovation and business culture in the domain of emerging technology.  He directs a number of ongoing projects and is working on a book titled Mediating Scale: From the Cosmic Zoom to Trans-Scalar Ecology.</p>
                <p>He has an MFA in Film Directing from the American Film Institute Conservatory, studied Philosophy and Creative Writing at Oxford University, and earned his BA in both Media Arts and Philosophy at the University of California, San Diego. He was the 2002 recipient of the national Cary Grant Film Award for his short film work.  In 2009, after four years of work, he completed his “Disaster Trilogy,” three feature-length films that examine middle-class American culture during the first years of the new millennium.  From 2010 to 2014 he directed Swerve, a ten-chapter, serialized science fiction epic that explores the nature of embodiment, virtuality, contamination and/of the natural, nanotechnology, and posthuman identity.  The film, which runs over three and a half hours, was a collaboration between professional filmmakers and actors, graduate students, undergraduate students, and faculty at UCSB.</p>
                <p>In 2016 Zach launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to produce the world’s first fully open, universal camera system for still photography.  The result, still under development, is the Mercury.</p>

                 <p>Broadly speaking, my work focuses on aesthetic components of personhood in the modern West. I am interested in the history of forms, genres, affects, and rhythms that have constituted what a self feels like in (centrally) Europe and the United States. “Aesthetic” refers to cultural products like operas and movies, but it also refers to the genres and forms that organize and make sense of ordinary life. A lot of my method involves looking at narrative musical works (i.e. opera, film) as imprints or codifications of shapes and gestures that try to get at what something might have felt like in a certain historical moment.</p>
                <p>As a result, I have focused on the "scene" as an aesthetic container in which abstract humanist concepts (for example, self-determination, empathy, love) can be represented in a fantasized zone of contact whose scale is visceral, bodily and intimate. But the scene can work in a variety of genres: different aspects of my work explore scenic thinking in relation to romantic love, political transformation, or the aspiration to the presence of “living in the moment.” These constitute an archive of normative sensations that promise to deliver the saturated experience of being alive. As a musicologist and cultural theorist, I’m interested in how popular culture renders these experiences as aesthetic rhythm in genres like the romantic comedy and the political melodrama, and their predecessors (such as Italian comic opera). The aim is to show how the poetics of film image and form, and the aesthetic structure of operatic and film music, can tell us what it has taken to feel like a person in the cultures of the West.</p>
                <p>I've written about 19th-century stage melodrama, speeches in Hollywood film, Wagner and addiction, sentimentality and politics, Asian American aesthetics in the public sphere, and Colin Firth movies, among other things. Teaching at Pitt since 2018.</p>
